# PostMarketOS-Samsung-I927
This repo will contain data related to the Samsung-I927 PMOS attempt

# Status
Does not boot(maxamum attention hook does nothing so assumed boot was not started)

Device shows exclaimation mark in a yellow triangle.
Reason: Official Samsung kernel is most likely being compiled by PMOS wrong.
