Does not boot(maxamum attention hook does nothing so assumed no boot was 
not started)

Device shows exclaimation mark in a yellow triagle.

Most likely boot image is found to be unbootable... This could be due to 
a misconfig of values in deviceinfo as the boot.img used cannot be 
tested as working yet. Looking into getting a stock boot.img from a 
running device, any help appreciated.
